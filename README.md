# irepl

interactive REPL for sbcl, mostly

## How do you install me?

```sh
mkdir ~/common-lisp
cd ~/common-lisp
git clone https://github.com/val314159/irepl

# for the command line only
cd /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s ~/common-lisp/irepl/bin/irepl
```

## How do you run me?

```sh
irepl
```

## What's the point?

 - I wanted a no-frills, yet some-frills REPL.

 - I don't really care about stack traces.
